# Songs_Recomendation_Model
 
I have developed a song recommendation model based on user similarity and song similarity. The model utilizes a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for machine learning and cosine similarity metrics to provide recommendations. This approach considers both users who listen to the same songs and the similarity between songs to deliver tailored recommendations.
